#Dronemap
Built using the [plus.io](https://github.com/plusio/frontend) Frontend

This map visualizes data from [http://dronestre.am](http://dronestre.am), using [leafletJs](http://leafletjs.com/).

Each circle on the map represents a reported drone strike and the size of the circle increases with the number of deaths involved and the circle turns red if any children died in the strike.
